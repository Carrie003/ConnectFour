# ConnectFour

A Connect Four Game that is played on a 7Ã—6 vertical grid. There are two players: a human user who uses red
coins, and an AI user who uses yellow coins. Players alternate taking turns, and each turn
consists of dropping a coin into a free column on the grid. Coins fall with gravity to the
lowest unoccupied row.
A player wins when they get four of their coins in a row (vertically, horizontally, or
diagonally). If the board fills up without a winner, a tie is declared.
